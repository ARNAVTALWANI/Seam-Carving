# Seam-Carving

A seam carving algorithm developed in C to resize images by dynamically calculating paths of least importance between pixels (“seams”) in a given image input and remove seams to reduce image size to display images without distortion using various data structures and computer vision algorithms to split RGB channel information to analyze pixels.
